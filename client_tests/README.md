# MMSS_Server: Client Tests

Using [Node.js]() and the [Express framework]() for request handling and some HTML files for output handling, we can test the API of the MMSS_Server to compare what we see with each request to what we expect to see.

In actual usage, the mobile application is the one handling and processing requests. However, with the setup in this folder, we can easily test the API without having to use the application.
